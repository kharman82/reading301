**Acceptance**

- The first article talked about a young lady by the name of Julia Rozovsky who had the wrong assumption about working in groups and finding the right team.  
- She had a few situations where she thought she was getting along with co-workers who came from similar settings and schools. In turn, she felt that were going to fit right in and everything was going to be fine.  
- This wasn't the case for her. She had been placed in different group situations over the years and found that each group partnering was different.  
- Stress became a real thing. Acceptance was another issue. She was constantly feeling overwhelmed and under a lot of stress. She had felt like she was always on the chopping block and needed to prove herself.  
- She then started to study with another group and this project ended up being in correlation with how groups work together and why certain groups work well and others don't.  
- Long story short, she ended up publishing a write up for her company and colleges explaining the differences in people and group activities, along with the studies of behaviors when others are paired into groups where they may have though they didn't fit in vs a group they felt would be a great fit. Most of the time it turned out that the people who thought it wouldn't be a good fit ended up being a great fit because of the diversity and differences that people had to bring to the table. Whereas the people with all the similarities tend to have issues and lack of variety/ diversity.  
- By the end all this, she graduated Yale and ended up working for Google working on peoples study habits.  

**REST**  

- This article was interesting. It had talked about the way the internet communicates with other machines.  
- It is in the view of two siblings talking together with each other and discussing how the internet works. How the internet communicates differently with humans vs machines. The idea behind it all was for humans to communicate with the internet but the though of having multiple computers work together and communicate in a big mass hadn't quite been perfected. Roy Fielding was a super smart guy who helped write the first web services and helped get things moving in the right direction to getting every machine to be able and communicate.   
- The article started to dig into how computers talk with using nouns. Then they have also incorporated using verbs universally to be able to communicate with those machines of like topics (verbs and nouns) and getting a response from them all!
