**What is Node.js?**  
- Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.  
- Creator of Node is Ryan Dahl.  

**Excellent Support for Modern JS**  
- Node has excellent support for ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) and beyond. As you’re only targeting one runtime (a specific version of the V8 engine), this means that you can write your JavaScript using the latest and most modern syntax. It also means that you don’t generally have to worry about compatibility issues — as you would if you were writing JavaScript that would run in different browsers.  
- Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm.   
- In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world’s largest software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download, with billions of downloads per week.  

**What is Node.js used for?**  
- Can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.  
- "And if you want to start developing apps with any modern JavaScript framework (for example, React or Angular), you’ll be expected to have a working knowledge of Node and npm (or maybe Yarn). This isn’t because you need a Node back end to run these frameworks. You don’t. Rather, it’s because these frameworks (and many, many related packages) are all available via npm and rely on Node to create a sensible development environment in which they can run".   
- Node.js, however, is the first implementation to gain any real traction, and it provides some unique benefits, compared to traditional languages.  
- Node.js, however, is single-threaded. It’s also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event.  
- Node’s execution model causes the server very little overhead, and consequently it’s capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections.    
**What kind of apps is Node.js suited to ?**  
- "Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration — for example, chat sites, or apps such as CodeShare, where you can watch a document being edited live by someone else. It’s also a good fit for building APIs where you’re handling lots of requests that are I/O driven (such as those needing to perform operations on a database), or for sites involving data streaming, as Node makes it possible to process files while they’re still being uploaded. If this real-time aspect of Node is something you’d like to look into more, check out our tutorial on Building a Real-time Chat App."  

**Advantages?!**  
- You can do everything in the same language and no longer need to keep switching back and forth.  
- Works great with JSON!  
- JSON is ideally suited for consumption by a JavaScript program, meaning that when you’re working with Node, data can flow neatly between layers without the need for reformatting. You can have one syntax from browser to server to database.  
- JS is ubiquitous!
- Can be used to automate repetitive tasks to help prevent errors.
