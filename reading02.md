_How does pair programming work?_  
-  Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard.  

_Why pair program?_  
- Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to othersâ€™ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.  
- It brings greater efficiency ! Having a second set of eyes on things is great. Having even more eyes on your group work is even better. The more the better in my opinion.  
- I feel it also allows you to work with others that have different learning styles. This is also important because not everyone realizes that in the real world you may be paired with people of all different backgrounds and levels of experience!  
- The ability to learn from others is big! Problem solving becomes much different than that of doing it by yourself because you are getting a different outlook on it. Gives you a chance to step outside the box. 
-  Also helps with the readiness of being able to interview and adjust and perfect those skills.

_jQuery_  

- what is jQuery? jQuery is a simple way to achieve a variety of JS tasks and helps clean code up. Shorten up the code and create efficiency.  

- This is a file that is included into your JS and webpages.

- In short  jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.  
- Looping can be achieved through this. Chaining is also something that is used in a line of code when necessary.
