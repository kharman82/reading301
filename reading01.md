__Responsive Overview__  

- Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop.  

- Responsive and adaptive web design are closely related, and often transposed as one in the same. Responsive generally means to react quickly and positively to any change, while adaptive means to be easily modified for a new purpose or situation, such as change.  

- Responsive web design is broken down into three main components, including flexible layouts, media queries, and flexible media. The first part, flexible layouts, is the practice of building the layout of a website with a flexible grid, capable of dynamically resizing to any width. Flexible grids are built using relative length units, most commonly percentages or em units.   

__Media Queries__  

- Media queries were built as an extension to media types commonly found when targeting and including styles. Media queries provide the ability to specify different styles for individual browser and device circumstances, the width of the viewport or device orientation.  

-  Media features identify what attributes or properties will be targeted within the media query expression.  

-  The height and width features are based off the height and width of the viewport rendering area, the browser window for example. Values for these height and width media features may be any length unit, relative or absolute. 

__Mobile First__  

- Mobile First is one of the popular techniques with using media queries which is referred to as mobile first . 

- The thought behind this was that a mobile user shouldn't have to load desktop layout for a mobile device. It should be simpler and manageable. 

**CSS Floats**  

- Floating is the sense of being able to push your content to one end or the other of your work and have the rest of the material go around it depending on the direction and layout. Floats are also helpful for layout in smaller instances. 

- Clear has four valid values as well. Both is most commonly used, which clears floats coming from either direction. Left and Right can be used to only clear the float from one direction respectively. None is the default, which is typically unnecessary unless removing a clear value from a cascade. Inherit would be the fifth, but is strangely not supported in Internet Explorer.  

__SMACSS__  

- pronounced “smacks”  
- Pretty much a style guide to keep things clean and professional. Its a layout format for your CSS  
- stands for Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS.
