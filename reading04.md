**CSS Grid Layout**  
- most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows.  
-  You work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element which becomes the Grid Container and to that element’s children which become Grid Items.  
 - grid - generates a block level grid  
 - inline-grid - generates an inline-level grid. 

**grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows**  
- defines the columns and rows of the grid with a space-separated list of values.
    - track-size – can be a length, a percentage, or a fraction of the free space in the grid (using the fr unit).  
    - line-name – an arbitrary name of your choosing.  

- grid-template-areas - Defines a grid template by referencing the names of the grid areas which are specified with the grid-area property.
