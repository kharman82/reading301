**Diversity and Inclusion**  
  
- Diversity in the work place is a great idea and it is interesting to see where the workplace has responded to this need. Some people at one point has probably thought about how diversity could probably benefit the company they are working for. The problem is that many companies tend to no want to "Reinvent the wheel" for lack of better terms. This essentially means that they don't want to change their ways. Most feel that the way they are currently running the company is best and has shown that historically.   

- It really hasn't been until the tech companies started to come around where people started to be concerned about social interaction, diversity and thinking outside the box could do for their companies.  

- The tech companies started to lead the way on this thought process. They realized that it doesn't matter what you look like, where you are from, what your history may have been, but, the fact that you have a skill set that stands out and may be different from the norm. More concerned about what sort of difference this individual can bring to the table started to be more important. This was the beginning of a whole new trend. Better results where starting to display for these companies that decided to take a different approach.  

- Historically speaking, it is interesting to see how and who these big gaming companies were targeting their customers or audiences. In most cases, if it had to do with computers or gaming systems, boys/males were targeted as the main customers. This was what sold and the companies realized this in the 80's. However little by little the gaming market went down-hill and was flooded with low quality products losing the interest of the targeted groups.  

- Later in the 90's when programing started to take off there was a study that was done regarding men and women in the studies of CS and the results of the testing in to the program. Majority of the men were able to test out into the more advanced programs. Whereas the women weren't able to test out and were opted to take the intro courses. THe level of knowledge was significantly different and the results had shown.
